## Extra

### Why Vue vs React?

- React is like a manual car, Vue is like an automatic car while Angular is like a plane.
- React has a very small API surface area which is easier to learn and help build complex structures but this openness
  can also lead to do bad unoptimized code if experience is not high
- Vue focuses on separation of CSS/HTML/JS while React likes to bundle everything together with JSX and CSS-in-JS
- If you are more experienced with JavaScript, React is a better choice otherwise Vue is a better choice
- If you have AngularJS experience, Vue (especially using Options API) would seem more familiar
- Vue is more opinionated than React but less than Angular
- Re-rendering is already handled by Vue so you don't have to worry about it unlike React
- It's easy to add VueJs natively to the browser without any build tools unlike React's JSX
- Vue is backed by the community while React is backed by Facebook
- Javascript is like Assembly, React is like C, Vue is like Javascript and Angular is like Java/.Net
